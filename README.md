🏠 Airbnb Host Retention Strategy – Data & AI Driven Marketing
This project uses machine learning and optimization to predict Airbnb host churn and design a targeted retention strategy. By allocating $1,000 incentives only where they yield positive ROI, the solution maximizes net profit and retention of high-value hosts.

📌 Problem Statement
Airbnb faces revenue risk from losing hosts—especially high earners. With limited resources for retention, the challenge is to predict host churn and identify which hosts should receive a $1,000 retention incentive to maximize future profit.

🎯 Objective
Build a data-driven framework that predicts churn, segments hosts by value, and optimally allocates retention gifts to maximize net profit while minimizing unnecessary spend.

🗂️ Dataset Overview
🏡 Host-level booking and revenue data (multi-year)

🌎 Geographic data (latitude/longitude, city)

📊 Behavioral features (annual revenue, churn label, booking frequency, etc.)

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Summary statistics, missing value treatment

Outlier handling via statistical methods

Feature engineering: spatial clusters (K-Means), revenue segments, dummy variables for categorical fields

🧠 Modeling & Retention Logic
Model training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees (with GridSearch CV)

Final model: Random Forest (81% test ROC)

Retention scoring: Calculate expected profit gain from retaining each host

Allocate $1,000 retention gift only where:
Expected revenue gain from retention > $1,000 incentive cost

📈 Results
Metric	Value
Test ROC (Random Forest)	0.81
Hosts Targeted	334
Total Spend	$334,000
Cohort Competition Rank	1st

The targeted retention approach maximized profit and topped the class leaderboard.

🧪 Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

scipy

🧠 Key Learnings
Combining churn modeling and expected revenue optimization can maximize marketing ROI.

Clustering and segmentation enable more nuanced retention targeting.

Model interpretability and business logic alignment are critical for adoption.

🚀 Future Work
Incorporate lifetime value prediction for more strategic targeting

Experiment with uplift modeling to directly estimate treatment effects

Deploy as a dashboard for Airbnb marketing teams

🤝 Acknowledgements
