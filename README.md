# Airbnb-Host-Retention-Strategy
This project predicts host churn for Airbnb in a major US city and designs a data-driven retention strategy. By identifying high-value hosts at risk of leaving, the team developed a framework to allocate $1,000 retention incentives in a way that maximizes Airbnbâ€™s net profit.
